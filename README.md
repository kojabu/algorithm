# Algorithm Implementations in Python

Welcome to my repository!

This project is dedicated to helping beginners in Computer Science understand and implement essential **Algorithms** and **Data Structures** using **Python**. The goal is to break down complex concepts and provide clear, practical examples to support learning.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this repository is to:

- Provide beginner-friendly explanations of popular algorithms and data structures.
- Offer Python implementations of these algorithms, written in a way that is easy to follow and understand.
- Help students and new developers practice coding these essential topics.
- Continuously update and improve with new algorithms, optimizations, and techniques.

## Structure

Each algorithm or data structure has its own dedicated folder containing:

- **Explanation**: A brief overview of the problem and algorithm.
- **Python Implementation**: A clean and readable code implementation.
- **Time and Space Complexity**: An analysis of the algorithm's performance.
- **Test Cases**: Example inputs and outputs to test the code.

## Topics Covered

- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Search algorithms (e.g., Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)
- Data structures (e.g., Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees)
- Dynamic programming and other advanced techniques (coming soon!)

## Contributing

This repository will be continuously updated, and feedback is welcome!  


Many of the concepts and algorithms covered here are inspired by the book *Grokking Algorithms* by Aditya Bhargava, which provides excellent visual explanations for beginners.
